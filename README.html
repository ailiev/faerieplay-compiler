<h1>Faerieplay Compiler</h1>

This is <code>sfdlc</code>, the Faerieplay compiler, which translates a high
level language into an arithmetic circuit extended with gates for accessing
indirect arrays.
<p>
  Please see also the introduction to the compiler in the <a href="doc/sfdlc.html#Introduction">manual</a> (available after <code>make doc</code> is run).

<h2>Languages</h2>

Sfdl&mdash;secure function definition language&mdash;is similar to C with a bit
of Pascal sprinkled in. Sfdlc also has support for a subset of C++, which is not
fully tested yet. Both languages are documented in the <a href="doc/sfdlc.html#Source-Languages">info manual</a>.

<h2>Using</h2>

Please consult the <a href="doc/sfdlc.html">manual</a> (which is built as
part of <a href="INSTALL.html">building</a> the compiler).
<p>
Also, an info file is built, <code>doc/sfdlc.info</code>:
<pre>
$ info -f doc/sfdlc.info
</pre>

<h2>Example programs</h2>

Several example programs are provided in <code>BASEDIR/sfdl/</code>.
<p>
The compiler has test programs in <code>tests/</code>.
