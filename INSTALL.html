<h1>Installing the Faerieplay compiler</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>ghc</code> (TODO url) version 6.4 or 6.6. Later versions may work, but major
ghc revisions may
  not be source-compatible with older versions. Also needs several Haskell
  packages which are not in the base library, but are released with ghc, or are easily available as optional packages (eg. in current Debian):
  <ul>
    <li> The functional graph library (fgl) (package <code>Data.Graph.Inductive</code>).
    <li> The Monad template library - mtl (package <code>Control.Monad</code>).
    <li> The "ditch your boilerplate" generic programming library (package
      <code>Data.Generics</code>).
</ul>  All these should be available with ghc, but may need to be installed
  separately.

<li> <code>bnfc</code> parser generator from <a
href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~markus/BNFC/">http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~markus/BNFC/</a>.
Sfdlc requires bnfc version 2.3b or later. Version 2.3b has more flexible
  support than 2.2 for placing the bnfc artifacts (lexer and parser files, as
  well as tartet language code).

<li> <code>happy</code>, the parser-generator (TODO url)

<li> <code>alex</code>, the lexer generator (TODO url)

<li> <code>ed</code>, the standard line-editor

</ul>

<h3>Optional prerequisites</h3>

Without these, some of the Makefile targets will not work

<ul>
  <li>hasktags
  <li>hmake
</ul>



<h2>Building</h2>
<pre>
$ make bnfc
$ make
$ make install
</pre>

<p>
The default is to build an optimized <code>sfdlc</code>.
<p>

Some makefile options:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>make NOOPT=1</pre></td>
    <td>builds non-optimized. Building is much faster, but the resulting
      compiler is quite slower, a factor of 2-3 times.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>make PROF=1</pre></td>
    <td>build a profiling executable. This can be used to gather time
      and heap profiling statistics.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>make DBG=1</pre></td>
    <td>build a debug version. This sfdlc can be run with
      "+RTS -xc -RTS" on the command line, which will produce a stack
      trace of sorts if an unexpected runtime error occurs.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

NOTE: the desired make flag needs to be provided to the "install" make target
too, or it will not install the desired executable but the default one.
