	* Unroll.hs: stuuupid bug in unrolling for-loops counting
	backwards - was counting up instead of down as I forgot to reverse
	the list.

	* Unroll.hs: enable the for-loop to count forwards and backwards
	by 1, depending on the relation of the endpoints.

	* sfdlc.hs: expanding the command line options to control the run
	file and output file better.

	* Runtime.hs: added printing of the input values of every gate.
