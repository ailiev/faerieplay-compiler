// Version svn-668 of sfdlc had a bug with assigning Output flags to gates if
// main() called another function directly - the Output flags on gates
// representing the result of the called function were not removed.

// This sample checks that case: compile and ensure there is only one gate with
// an Output flag.

program MainDirectCall
{

  const B=32;
  type Word = Int<B>;

  function Word f (Word x) {
    f = x * 3;
  }

  function Word sfdlmain (Word x) {
    sfdlmain = f(x);
  }
