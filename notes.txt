Analysis of what is static and what not:

Could check all expressions which should be static (eg. consts, int size, array
length) during first typecheck phase. but this is nasty to mix with actual
typechecking.

Perhaps have a second pass right away, which actually computes all available
static expressions? 

All consts should be available before unrolling? yes!

how to deal with structs?? name + offset? a set of separate names?

Current implementation of HoistStms will not handle a function call in an
l-value. this seems fairly sensible to prohibit.
