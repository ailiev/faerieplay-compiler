do not treat the function name as an implicit local variable, but just treat an
assignment like

Maybe annotate invalid values somehow - eg division by zero, array read/write
out of bounds, so if any make it to the output, we may know where the problem
comes from. ie. use an Either value :)

Add support for statement labels, which propagate to gates to facilitate lining
