enable for-loops to count up as well as down, depending on the relative values
of the endpoints.

do not treat the function name as an implicit local variable, but just treat an
assignment like
f = val;
as if it were
return val;
in more normal languages (see how Pascal semantics are perhaps)

Maybe annotate invalid values somehow - eg division by zero, array read/write
out of bounds, so if any make it to the output, we may know where the problem
comes from. ie. use an Either value :)

Add support for statement labels, which propagate to gates to facilitate lining
up the circuit and the code.

Add more comments to the .runtime file, to make it easier to figure out by
manual inspection. Eg. comment what a scalar types bitsize is, if it's actually
a Bool, etc.

CHECK: how do we make sure that the variables in a conditional's condition are
used with values from before the conditional, and not values generated inside
the conditional? Since I believe the condition's gate(s) are generated after the
branches.
